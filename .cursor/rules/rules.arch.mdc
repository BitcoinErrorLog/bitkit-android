### Business Layer Design Principles
- Always prefer creating specialized methods over complex inline logic
- If a feature implementation requires >5 lines of method chaining, extract to a new method
- New feature implementations should read like the business requirement

### API Design Guidelines
- Create domain-specific methods that match the business language
  - Method names should describe WHAT, not HOW
  - Hide complexity behind simple, single-purpose APIs

### Refactoring Triggers
- When implementing new features, always ask: "Does the business layer need a new method to support this cleanly?"
- If you see repeated patterns across different features, extract them into reusable methods
- Prefer failing fast with meaningful defaults over complex null handling in business logic

### Business Logic Method Design
- Service methods should handle their own error cases and return simple types
  - Let callers focus on business logic, not infrastructure concerns

### Implementation Priority
- Before writing complex feature logic, spend time designing the ideal API first
- Ask: "What would the cleanest possible calling code look like?" then work backwards
- Create the relevant methods needed to achieve that clean calling code
